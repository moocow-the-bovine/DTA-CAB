    README for DTA::CAB

ABSTRACT
    DTA::CAB - "Cascaded Analysis Broker" for error-tolerant linguistic
    analysis

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl Modules
        See "Makefile.PL", "META.json", and/or "META.yml" in the
        distribution directory. Perl dependencies should be available on
        CPAN <http://metacpan.org>.

        Additional Perl modules may be required by particular
        DTA::CAB::Analyzer subclasses. If you see errors like

         Can't locate foo.pm in @INC (you may need to install the foo module)

        ... then you should probably first try looking for the "foo" module
        on on CPAN <http://metacpan.org>.

    External Web-Service
        If you just want to use the client libraries to query an external
        "DTA::CAB" web-service, you'll need only the URL for that service
        and an active internet connection. See the DTA::CAB Web-Service
        HOWTO
        <http://odo.dwds.de/~jurish/software/DTA-CAB/doc/html/DTA.CAB.WebSer
        viceHowto.html> for an introduction.

    Language Resources
        If you want to do anything other than querying an external
        "DTA::CAB" web-service, you'll need a small menagerie of "gfsm"
        transducers and various assorted other language(-variant)-specific
        resources which are not included in this distribution, and for which
        (presumably) there exists no "one-size-fits-all" solution. Look at
        the documentation and code of the individual DTA::CAB::Analyzer
        subclasses you're interested in for more details.

DESCRIPTION
    The DTA::CAB package provides an object-oriented compiler/interpreter
    for error-tolerant heuristic morphological analysis of tokenized text.

INSTALLATION
    Issue the following commands to the shell:

     bash$ cd DTA-CAB-0.01   # (or wherever you unpacked this distribution)
     bash$ perl Makefile.PL  # check requirements, etc.
     bash$ make              # build the module
     bash$ make test         # (optional): test module before installing
     bash$ make install      # install the module on your system
